HTML Formal letter
=======

This piece of software creates formal letters and CVs using python and python's jinja2 templating.

I think this is a semi-good idea, because html is universally supported, easy to understand and manipulate by hand should you need to. I would prefer to never print a page in my life again, but humanity isn't there yet.

HTML is also extremely flexible in terms of styling and layout.

why not use...
---------

Latex, I did, then the package I used was discontinued and I couldn't fix my issues.

"Standard Office Software". I don't know about you, but I don't have the time or the patience for their UI, their loadtimes and all that. This script takes like 2 lists and a dict to fill in all the important parts. The positioning is somewhat fixed, but easy to adjust since html uses real measurements like mm.

Here is a letter:

If you actually want to print this, I've had problems removing the automatical adjustment for the area printers can't print in.

I'm also open to feedback to improve the style.
