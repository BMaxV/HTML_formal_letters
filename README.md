HTML Formal letter
=======

This piece of software creates formal letters and CVs using python and python's jinja2 templating.

I think this is a good idea, because html is universally supported, easy to understand and manipulate by hand should you need to.

It is also extremely flexible in terms of styling and layout.

Here is a letter:

If you actually want to print this, I've had problems removing the automatical adjustment for the area printers can't print in.

I'm also open to feedback to improve the style.
